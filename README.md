# streamlit_salarypredictorapp
My first deployed ML app on Streamlit! 

A simple software developer salary predictor, wherein the user can choose a country, their education level and the number of years of experience. The user can choose to either predict a salary, or they could also choose to view few statistics of software developer salaries with regards to location and years of experience.

Dataset taken from stackoverflow website.
